# Floriade AR Experience App

App made for the Floriade 2022 Expo in Almere that helps visitors visualize certain enviromental issues mentioned in the app and at the expo itself with augmented reality.

## Description

The Floriade AR Experience App is made to improve the visit to the Floriade Expo 2022 in Almere with various augmented reality features and geolocation feature.

1. What is about?
 - The app is made to inform visitors about the average Dutch national ecological footprint and how much should it be reduced to make it ideal/sustainable.
 - The users can visualize the Dutch national average footprint, the ideal national average footprint and they can calculate their own footprint by completing a short questionaire.
 - By pointing their phone to the Floriade Expo 2022 map the 3D model of the foot will be placed on the map and the user can visualize how big the footprints are.
2. Why React Native?
 - As a team we decided to use React Native because it seemed like the simplest and best option to develop for both iOS and Android. After 5 weeks of working on the project our group was instructed to merge with another group that was working on the same project and we split up into iOS development group and Android development group. Our group developed the Android part of the app.
 - With React Native we used Viro Media to develop the AR part, and even if it doesn't have extensive documentation we managed to make good use of it and the final AR product ended up just as the team planed/expected.
3. Challenges faced?
 - The biggest challenge we faced was managing to work with 2 different groups on the same product and making the product look the same or as simillar as it can look.
 - Since this was the first time developing a mobile app for every member of our group we all had to overcome the learning curve.
